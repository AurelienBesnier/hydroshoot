Installation

    conda install hydroshoot -c default -c openalea -c conda-forge


HydroShoot is a functional-structural plant modelling package. 

Hydroshoot is composed of 3 generic modules used to simulate:
	- xylem water transport (*hydraulic*)
	- leaves energy budget (*energy*)
	- leaves gas exchange fluxes (*exchange*).

Hydroshoot provides a grapevine-specific module (*architecture*) which builds plant shoot structure for potted of trained grapevines.
