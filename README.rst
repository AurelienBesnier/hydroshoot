**Overview**
HydroShoot is a functional-structural plant modelling package. It is built using the MTG (Multiscale Tree Graph) central data structure (Pradal et al., 2008).
Hydroshoot is composed of 4 generic modules used to simulate:
	irradiance interception (*irradiance*)
	xylem water transport (*hydraulic*)
	leaves energy budget (*energy*)
	and leaves gas exchange fluxes (*exchange*).
Hydroshoot provides a grapevine-specific module (*architecture*) which builds plant shoot structure for potted of trained grapevines.
