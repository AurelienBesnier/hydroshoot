--------

HydroShoot was created by Rami ALBASHA during his postdoctoral research (July 2015 to December 2016)
under the supervision of Eric LEBON†, in close collaboration with Christian FOURNIER and Christophe PRADAL.

The model is partly based on prior developments led by Gaëtan LOUARN and Jorge PRIETO who developed the FSPM TOPVINE
(`Louarn et al., 2008 <https://academic.oup.com/aob/article/101/8/1167/159779>`_,
`Prieto et al., 2012 <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2012.02491.x>`_).
The main difference between TOPVINE and HydroShoot is that the latter simulates explicitly the hydraulic network of the
shoot, which is coupled to both energy and gas exchange processes.
