Ecophysiological processes interactions
=======================================

Interactions among the physiological processes occur.

From the one hand. Leaf water potential (:math:`Psi`) exerts a control on stomatal conductance to water vapor
(:math:`g_s`) and, consequently, on transpiration flux (:math:`E`). However, the latter also determines how much
water will flow through the hydraulic segments to be withdrawn from the soil, which affects the distribution of
water potential across those segments (Ohm's law). Hence, we have a reciprocity between the distribution of water
potential across the shoot (hydraulic structure) and transpiration fluxes from individual leaves.

From the other hand, leaf temperature (:math:`T`) determines the rate of leaf photosynthesis (Arrhenius functions)
and stomatal conductance to :math:`CO_2` (:math:`g_{s, CO_2}`) and water vapor (:math:`g_{s, H_2O}`).
This means that :math:`T` affects also the transpiration flux :math:`E` which means that :math:`T` exerts a further
control on the hydraulic structure.

Putting it all together:
For a given initial temperature (:math:`T_0`) and soil water potential (:math:`\Psi_0`), a leaf can fix :math:`CO_2`
with a rate :math:`{An}_0` having a stomatal conductance rate of :math:`g_{s, \ H_2O, \ 0}.
The corresponding water flux transpired by this leaf will be :math:`E_0`. Summed up among leaves, transpiration will
withdraw water from the soil, giving a new value to :math:`\Psi`: :math:`\Psi_1`.
:math:`\Psi_1`, will hence impose a new stomatal conductance :math:`g_{s, \ H_2O, \ 1}` and consequently a new
transpiration flux :math:`E_1`. Yet, this new :math:`E_1` means that leaf temperature is :math:`T_1` !!
Same story again !
