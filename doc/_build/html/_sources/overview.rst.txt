What is HydroShoot about?
=========================
HydrShoot is a functional-structural plant model that simulates jointly the hydraulic structure of the plant's shoot,
gas-exchange, and energy-budget of individual leaves.

HydroShoot is static, that is it does not simulate plant growth or development. Hence, its usage would only be sound
if shoot's structure can be assumed constant across a given time span (let's say a week or so for grapevine).


Why would you be interested in it?
==================================
HydroShoot may be useful for example if you would like to explore:

- how leaf carbon assimilation rate (:math:`A_n`), transpiration (:math:`E`), temperature (:math:`T`) and
  bulk water potential (:math:`\Psi_{leaf}`) vary across the canopy
- how soil water status impacts :math:`A_n`, :math:`E`, :math:`T`, and :math:`\Psi_{leaf}`
- how the structure of the shoot impacts :math:`A_n`, :math:`E`, :math:`T`, and :math:`\Psi_{leaf}`
- how soil water potential (:math:`\Psi_{soil}`) propagates across plant's shoot
